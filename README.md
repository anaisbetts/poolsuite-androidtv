# poolsuite for Android TV

This is a crappy application I threw together in an hour to get [Poolsuite](https://www.poolsuite.net) onto my TV, because I don't own any fruit devices

## To build

1. Install Android Studio and Flutter (I used v2.2.1) and put it in your path
1. `flutter build apk`
1. `adb install -r build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`

## Why don't you build it for me?

I'm too lazy to make a release keystore

## How do I pause / next track / literally anything other than listen to the current track

You can't, I'm extremely lazy
